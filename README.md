# Image Comparison App 

## Overview

The Image Comparison App is a Flutter application designed to compare two images and visualize their differences. This app allows users to select two images from their gallery, compares them pixel by pixel, and then displays the comparison results on the screen, highlighting differences without relying on external libraries for the comparison logic.

## Features

* No External Libraries for Comparison: The comparison logic is implemented natively, without using any third-party libraries specifically for the comparison process.
* Online Demo Available: Try out the app without installing it using the online demo.
